The Madness of King JavaScript
==============================

From time to time, people notice something is very wrong with functional-style programming in JavaScript. For example:

```javascript
['1', '2', '3'].map(parseFloat)
  //=> [1, 2, 3]
  
// HOWEVER:

['1', '2', '3'].map(parseInt)
  //=> [ 1, NaN, NaN ]
```

Shouts of "William-Thomas-Fredrick" ensue. The strange behaviour of `.map(parseInt)` is caused by the interaction of one language choice and two library choices. When all three come together, you get an unexpected result:

1. The language feature is that JavaScript does not enforce function arity. So you can define a function with three arguments but pass one parameter. Or pass five parameters to a function that only expects one.
2. `.map` is designed such that it passes *three* parameters to the mapper function. The first is the element, the second is the index of the element, and the third is the context (the array, in this case).
3. `.parseInt` works just fine with one parameter, but [you can also pass an additional parameter to define the radix](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt).

So what happens here? Well, the `.map` method is passing in a string and a number on each call, and `parseInt` is interpreting that number as a radix. Boom.

Okay. So?

Well, reasonable people can take either or both of the following two positions:

1. You need to know your language and libraries. If you don't, you're at fault.
2. Libraries should be designed to avoid suprises. `.map` being so "helpful" with the extra parameters is not helpful and contrary to practice elsewhere. This is a design problem, not a programmer problem. (There should be a `.map` and a `.mapWithIndex` in the library, not one function trying to do too many jobs)

There's plenty of opportunity to debate those positions, but if you have chosen to use JavaScript because on the whole it's a good thing for a particular project, here are two different things you can do to avoid surprising yourself or colleagues who haven't read this blog post.

### use a safer mapping construct

There's nothing wrong with rolling your own mapper. I'm a big fan of combinators, so I use `.splat` from the [allong.es] library. Splat looks like this:

```javascript
function splat (fn) {
  fn = functionalize(fn);
  return function (list) {
    return __map.call(list, function (something) { return fn(something) })
  }
};
```

And we use it like this:

```javascript
splat = require('oscin.es').splat

splat(parseInt)(['1', '2', '3'])
  //=> [1, 2, 3]
```

Splat look a little different than map because instead of operating directly on an array, it turns a function expecting one argument into a "splatter" expecting an array. And of course, there's a `splatWithIndex` if that's what you need, although your should probably just use `.map` for that.

### use a safer function

The [allong.es] library includes a very handy "variadic" function for turning a function that takes one argument into a function that takes more than one argument. It also includes `unary` for turning a function that takes more than one argument into a function that takes one argument, it looks like this:

```javascript
function unary (fn) {
  fn = functionalize(fn);
  var fnLength = fn.length;

	if (fn.length == 1) {
		return fn
	}
	else return function (something) {
		return fn.call(this, something)
	}
} 
```

We use it like this:

```javascript
unary = require('oscin.es').unary

['1', '2', '3'].map(unary(parseInt))
  //=> [ 1, 2, 3 ]
```

JavaScript can have some surprises for us, but it has an inherent functional flexibility that allows us to make our own sandpaper to smooth out its knots and whorls.
