# Somewhere, a CoffeeScript Village is Missing Its Idiot

In [Combinatory Logic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic), the "I Combinator" is charming in its simplicity:

```coffeescript
I = (x) -> x
```

In his rightfully famous [To Mock a Mockingbird](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0192801422?ie=UTF8&tag=raganwald001-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0192801422), Raymond Smullyan nicknamed it "The Idiot Bird" for its singlemindedness.

`I`--so named because mathematicians (and many programmers) call it the [Identity Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function)--has some useful applications in JavaScript. Sometimes you have a function or method that takes an optional mapping function, like this:

```coffeescript
class TheyMightBeGiants
  # ...
  all: (fn) ->
    if fn?
      fn(giant) for giant in giants
    else
      giants
```

Given:

```coffeescript
band = new TheyMightBeGiants(...)
```

You can call either `band.all()` or to get all the band members or `band.all( (x) -> x.name )` to get their names. An "idiot" will clean things up and get rid of the `if`:

```coffeescript
class TheyMightBeGiants
  # ...
  all: (fn = I) ->
    fn(giant) for giant in giants
```

Idiots can be used as default arguments in many different places. Another interesting application falls out of the fact that CoffeeScript's evaluation strategy is "strict, left-to-right, and call-by-sharing with loose matching of arguments to parameters." That means that when you write something like:

```coffeescript
foo( expr1, expr2, expr3, expr4 )
```
    
expr1 is evaluated first, then expr2, then expr3, then expr4. Always. Then the arguments are stuffed into the `arguments` pseudo-variable whether they match declared parameters or not. What this means is that we can write something like this:

```coffeescript
begin = (ignored..., value) -> value
```
    
Now, you can write:

```coffeescript
begin(
  x = 5,
  x = x + 1,
  x * 2
)
  #=> 12
```

This is just the same as if you used the comma operator in JavaScript, `begin... end` in Ruby, or the `begin` macro in Scheme. `begin` creates a block of expressions to be evaluated, and returns the last one, but deliberately doesn't create a new scope.

Hopefully you never write `begin` like this in CoffeeScript, because there is a simpler way to accomplish the same result:

```coffeescript
( expr1; expr2; expr3; expr4 )
```
  
Same thing. So why do we care about `begin`? Only an idiot would write that! Well, consider this variation:

```coffeescript
begin1 = (value, ignored...) -> value
```
    
That executes a series of statements and returns the value of *the first one*. And yes, Scheme does have a [begin1](http://patricklogan.blogspot.ca/2005/08/when-to-create-syntax-in-lisp.html)  macro (old Lisps called it `PROG1`).

Again, there's a simpler way to write `begin1` in CoffeeScript:

```coffeescript
begin1 = (value) -> value
```

It's our "idiot" again! Can we use it like `begin`? yes! Compare it to Underscore's  `_.tap(value, fn)`:

```coffeescript
    _.tap expr1, (value) ->
      expr2
      expr3
      # ... 
```

`_.tap` lets you use a function that takes the value of `expr1` as a parameter. That might be what you want, in which case use `_.tap`. But if you don't need it, `begin1( ..., ..., ... )` evaluates everything in the scope of the enclosing function. So you can create normal case variables, return from the enclosing function, and otherwise behave as if you were using `( ...; ...; ... )`.

Here's an example where we use the idiot to implement a simple [fluent interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface):

```coffeescript
Folderol::aFluentMethod = (arg1, arg2) ->
  begin1( this,
    doSomethingImportant(),
    this.set
      something: arg1
      somethingElse: arg2,
    doSomethingElse(arg1),
    finishWithThis(arg2)
  )
```

Why might you need this idiom? There are two answers. The first is that identifying that a function returns `this` but is being executed for side effects is nice to have at the top of the function rather than the bottom. And you won't forget to include `return this` and accidentally return `undefined`. 

Other times, you want to do something after calculating a return value, and you end up with some awkward code and an extra variable:

```javascript
Folderol::aFluentMethod = (arg1, arg2) ->
  value = ...some calculation...
  # do something
  # and something
  # and something else
  value
```

`begin1` can make that go away as well. If you're using underscore, use `_.tap`, it's an idiot in upscale clothes. But if not, `I` or `begin1` is an easy one-liner you can pull out.

The moral of the story? *Every CoffeeScript village ought to have its own idiot*. If yours is missing, write yourself a new one. The I Combinator isn't exactly a go-to function in the toolbox, but one to keep in mind for the odd time it can make things a little simpler.

p.s. It seems that [JavaScript villages have idiots too](https://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2012/10/idiot.js.md).
