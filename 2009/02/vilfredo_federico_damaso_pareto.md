Vilfredo Pareto on Software Product Management
===

My conjecture:

1. 20% of the features are responsible for 80% of the headaches of software development, and;
2. 20% of the features are responsible for 80% of the value of the software to its users.

My question:

> Are those the **same** 20% of the features on your project? If not, why not?
