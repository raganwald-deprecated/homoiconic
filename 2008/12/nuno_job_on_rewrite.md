Nuno Job on Rewrite
===

I received a very nice email from [Nuno Job](http://github.com/dscape). Here it is with a few minor edits:

> Hi,  
>  
> I was watching your lecture ([video on infoq](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/braithwaite-rewrite-ruby), [slides and comments](http://github.com/raganwald/presentation_decks/tree/master/rubyfringe "rubyfringe at master from raganwald's presentation_decks &mdash; GitHub")) and quite enjoyed it.  
>  
> In one of your last slides you where doing advanced recursion on a tree and wanted to share this book with you: [Program Design by Calculation](http://www.di.uminho.pt/~jno/ps/pdbc_fm.pdf "PDF Download").  
>  
> It's mostly [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/ "Haskell - HaskellWiki") but the recursion over trees is quite something else and I think your work might benefit from it.  
>  
> [Here's a little sample of code](http://github.com/dscape/pointfreeexprsimplication/tree/master/ExpTree.hs "ExpTree.hs at master from dscape's pointfreeexprsimplication &mdash; GitHub") written with this kind of generic fold mechanisms for a tree (in this case a pointfree exp tree).

> Best,
