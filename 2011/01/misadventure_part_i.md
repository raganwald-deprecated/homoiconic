Misadventure, Part I: Overview
===

*Misadventure is a little game written on top of Faux and Backbone.js*

**introduction**

[Misadventure][play] is a little game in the style of [Adventure][a]. Misadventure is written in JavaScript and runs entirely in the browser. Misadventure is written in standard Model-View-Controller style, making heavy use of the [Faux][f] and [Backbone.js][b] libraries. In this series of posts I will give you a tour of Misadventure's [code][source], showing how it uses Faux to structure its routes and templates as well as how it uses Backbone.js to organize its models and interactive view code.

This is Part I, wherein we look at the game and its controller. In [Part II][pii], we'll start our examination of controller methods with a look at `controller.wake()`. In [Part III][piii], we'll look at a controller method that wires a model, a collection, and a view up to a template. In [Part IV][piv], we'll do a double-take and talk about loading classes.

Open [http://unspace.github.com/misadventure][play] in your browser.

Misadventure starts inauspiciously:

<a target="_blank" href="http://min.us/mvkEt6y#1"><img src="http://i.min.us/jeaApo.png" border="0"/></a>

You notice that a *fragment* of [#/wake][wake] has been added to the URL, but the base URL hasn't changed. Since Single Page Interface architecture is all the rage these days, you already know that this means that the contents of the page are being loaded into the DOM without refreshing the entire page. That requires much less bandwidth and scales faster than rendering pages from the server.

Let's get back to using the game. You have two options. If you experiment, you discover that closing your eyes doesn't appear to do anything at this point, but if you stand up and look around, you'll get something like this:

<a target="_blank" href="http://min.us/mvkEt6y#2"><img src="http://i.min.us/jefdsa.png" border="0"/></a>

The fragment has changed again, now it's [#/42492610216140747/7624672284554068][l1]. You can move North by clicking the link or pressing the up arrow on the keyboard. Things appear to be the same, but the fragment has changed again, now it's [#/42492610216140747/5682321739861935][l2]. Moving North one more time takes you to what appears to be a different page:

<a target="_blank" href="http://min.us/mvkEt6y#3"><img src="http://i.min.us/jeflO8.png" border="0"/></a>

And the fragment has changed yet again, now it's [#/42492610216140747/3916709493533819][l3]. We just moved North. What happens if we move South? Let's investigate. First, each possible move is a standard HTML link. There's no magic JavaScript. Let's look at the link to move South. It's the same URL, but the fragment looks familiar: [#/42492610216140747/5682321739861935][l2]. That's interesting, it's the exact same fragment that we were on a move ago.

And looking at the page, we see that the link to move South is colored <font color='red'>red</font>. There's no special magic going on. It's a standard link and it goes to a place that's still in the browser's history, so it is styled differently, just like any other link. We'll see how that works later, but let's try something else.

Use the back button or back command in your browser. It takes you to your previous location, just as if each location int he maze is a standard web page with its own unique link. That's because each location does have a unique link and behaves exactly like a standard web page. This means that all of the things you or any user expects from a page in a browser work here. You can navigate forward and back, bookmark locations, even mail links to friends.

Did you notice that in this document we're using links for the fragments? If you travel to the game through the links, you wind up in exactly the same maze in exactly the same location. The links are *stable*. We'll come back to how that works when we look at the code, but it's a key point, so we'll emphasize it:

> Everything you see in Misadventure has a unique URL and works with your browser's existing mechanisms like bookmarks or navigating backwards and forwards. The URLs are stable and are not tied to a temporary "session."

You can continue to navigate your way through the corn maze. Try using an arrow key instead of clicking a link. With patience and a little knowledge of how to recursively search a tree, you may eventually find your way to the exit and leave the corn maze:

<a target="_blank" href="http://min.us/mvkEt6y#4"><img src="http://i.min.us/jbJZZ8.png" border="0"/></a>

And by now you will not be surprised to discover that the final page has a fragment too: [#/42492610216140747/bed][bed]. Do you want to play again? Simply click [close your eyes][wake], and you'll find yourself playing in a brand new maze, with all different fragments. Have fun and when you come back, we'll take a look at the code that makes this work. 

**summary of what we've learned from misadventure's user experience**

Before we look at the code, here's a quick summary of what we've seen:

1. Every "page" has its own unique URL
2. Pages all have the same base URL, but the fragments change
3. The DOM is being refreshed in the browser
4. The URLs are stable and can be bookmarked or shared with other users
5. All standard navigation elements (e.g. back, forwards, links) work in standard ways
6. Misadventure also supports non-standard navigation in the form of arrow keys

Now we'll see how Misadventure uses Faux and Backbone.js to make this happen.

A few points of interest:

1. We include jQuery, Underscore, Backbone.js, amd haml-js before we include Faux;
2. The only Misadventure file we load is [controller.js][cjs];
3. There's a very interesting DOM element, `<div class="content"></div>`.

Looking in the [haml][haml] directory, we see three [Haml][haml-lang] templates: `wake.haml`, `location.haml`, and `bed.haml`. We're going to see where those are used shortly.

controller.js
---

Let's look at [controller.js][cjs]. It's the last file to be loaded, and it starts the application for us. Eliding the comments, we have:

    ;(function () {

    var controller = new Faux.Controller({
      save_location: true,
      element_selector: '.content',
      partial: 'haml',
      partial_suffix: '.haml',
      javascript: 'javascripts',
      title: 'Misadventure'
    });

    controller

      .begin({
        'seed=': {
          locations: function (locations) { return locations.seed; },
          '': function () { return Math.random().toString().substring(2); }
        },
        'locations=': {
          seed: function (seed) { return LocationCollection.find_or_create({ seed: seed }); }
        }
      })

        .method('wake')
  
        .method('bed', {
          route: ':seed/bed'
        })

        .method('location', {
          route: ':seed/:location_id'
        })
    
        .end();


      $(function() {
        controller.define_all(function () {
          Backbone.history.start();
          window.location.hash || controller.wake();
        });
      });
	
    })();

The first statement creates a new instance of `Faux.Controller`. Faux controllers extend Backbone.js's [controllers][bc]. When the program is running, they parse fragments and manage the history so that invoking an URL through a link results in calling a controller method.

Faux the library is nothing more than a backbone controller that has a bunch of helpers for writing Backbone.js controller methods for us. The most important such helper is the `.method` method. Looking at `controller.js`, you can se that we call `.method` three times:

    .method('wake')

    .method('bed', { ...configuration... })

    .method('location', { ...configuration... })
    
We now have enough information to explain Misadventure's basic structure:

1. There are three controller methods invoked during gameplay: `.wake(...)`, `.location(...)`, and `.bed(...)`
2. Each of those controller methods has a route, and Backbone.js will invoke the controller method when the browser invokes the URL.
3. The controller methods that Faux writes will use the templates `wake.haml`, `location.haml`, and `bed.haml` to display content in the page.
4. The content will be injected into the `<div class="content"></div>` DOM element on the page.

We haven't explained anything else about views, models, parsing parameters out of URL, or even defining which URLs invoke which methods yet. All of these things are driven by convention and configuration (preferring convention over configuration, of course).

**what is a controller method?**

If you're comfortable with a web framework like Ruby on Rails, you already know what a controller method is: A controller method is the application code that services a request or performs an action. All of the controller methods defined in Misadventure display something in the page using a template.

These three controller methods are all associated with routes. Controller methods can also be invoked directly in JavaScript. For example, invoking `controller.location({ seed: '42492610216140747', id: '7624672284554068' })` has exactly teh same effect as directing your browser to [#/42492610216140747/7624672284554068](http://unspace.github.com/misadventure/#/42492610216140747/7624672284554068). Faux even updates the browser's location bar so that bookmarking and navigation works correctly.

If you dive deeply into Faux, you'll also discover that controller methods can be associated with events or with DOM elements, such that inserting a DOM element with a specific `id` and/or classes automatically invokes a controller method to populate it with children. Misadventure doesn't use any of these techniques. They aren't "advanced" or "complicated," but Misadventure is a small app and doesn't need to use every tool in the toolbox.

Controller methods are part of Backbone.js. Faux builds on Backbone by providing a DSL for writing controller methods, and it works with Backbone's route support. But underlying it all is a perfectly standard MVC architecture.

Now let's look at how each method is configured.

**in the beginning**

Faux methods are configured with objects, usually object literals. To facilitate sharing configuration between methods, Faux provides a lexical scoping mechanism, `.begin({...})` and `.end()`. `.begin({...})` introduces configuration that applies to all of the `.method(...)` calls until `.end()` is called. You can nest calls to `.begin({...})`,and we see that in controllers.js.

Faux methods are also configured by default according to certain naming conventions. We will discuss some more later, but for now the most important one is that unless otherwise specified, the name of the method is part of its route.

The code above is equivalent to:

    controller

      .method('wake', {
        route: '/wake',            // <- by convention, from the name
        partial: 'haml/wake.haml', // <- by convention, from the name
        clazz: false,              // <- by convention, from the name
        'seed=': {                 // <- 'inherited' from .begin(...)
          locations: function (locations) { return locations.seed; },
          '': function () { return Math.random().toString().substring(2); }
        },
        'locations=': {
          '': function () { return LocationCollection.find_or_create(); },
          seed: function (seed) {  // <- 'inherited' from .begin(...)
            return LocationCollection.find_or_create({ seed: seed }); 
          }
        }
      })

      .method('bed', {
        route: '/:seed/bed',
        partial: 'haml/bed.haml',  // <- by convention, from the name
        clazz: BedView,            // <- by convention, from the name
        'seed=': {                 // <- 'inherited' from .begin(...)
          locations: function (locations) { return locations.seed; },
          '': function () { return Math.random().toString().substring(2); }
        },
        'locations=': {            // <- 'inherited' from .begin(...)
          seed: function (seed) { return LocationCollection.find_or_create({ seed: seed }); }
        }
      })

      .method('location', {
        route: '/:seed/:location_id'
        partial: 'haml/location.haml', // <- by convention, from the name
        model_clazz: Location,         // <- by convention, from the name
        clazz: LocationView,           // <- by convention, from the name
        'seed=': {                     // <- 'inherited' from .begin(...)
          locations: function (locations) { return locations.seed; },
          '': function () { return Math.random().toString().substring(2); }
        },
        'locations=': {                // <- 'inherited' from .begin(...)
          seed: function (seed) { return LocationCollection.find_or_create({ seed: seed }); },
          location: function (location) { return location.collection; } // <- by convention, from the name
        },
        'location_id': {               // <- by convention, from the name
          location: function (location) { return location.id; }
        },
        'location=': {                 // <- by convention, from the name
          'locations location_id': function (locations, location_id) { return locations.get(location_id); }
        }
      })

Now that we know the 'expanded' configuration for each method, we can see what they do.

**routes and parameters**

Each of the methods we're defining will be bound to a route. Faux binds controller methods to routes unless you explicitly write `route: false` in a method's configuration. In two of the methods we've explicitly specified the route. In the third, we've let Faux infer the route from the method name.

Many routes have parameters. Faux and Backbone.js both use the same convention, namely anything that looks like a variable name prefixed by `:` is a parameter. So when the browser invokes [#/42492610216140747/bed][bed], the controller matches this against the route `/:seed/bed` and it's a match. Faux then invokes our controller method `controller.bed({ seed: '42492610216140747' })`.

*Nota Bene: Faux and Backbone differ slightly in how parameters are passed to controller methods. In plain vanilla Backbone,* `#/42492610216140747/bed` *would invoke* `controller.bed('42492610216140747')`*, whereas Faux bundles parameters into a hash of names and values.*

So now we know that there are three controller methods, that each has a route, and that when the route is invoked, parameters are parsed out and provided to the controller method in a hash. We haven't discussed all the `'seed='` configurations, we'll get to that after we explain how the application launches.

**launching the application**

As you know from jQuery, this code:

    $(function() {
      controller.define_all(function () {
        Backbone.history.start();
        window.location.hash || controller.wake();
      });
    });
    
...is run when the page has loaded. Becasue some definitions might take a while for Faux to process, Faux actually defers building all of the methods we defined them until you call `controller.define_all`. So we call it after the page has loaded, and we pass it a callback function to execute when it finishes with all of the definitions. Let's look at what we want to do once all of the methods are defined:

`Backbone.history.start();` initializes Backbone's support for managing URLs. The next line checks to see whether the current URL has a fragment. If it doesn't, it invokes the controller method `.wake()` to start the application in a new cornfield.

So now we know that when our application is launched by loading its URL, if we have a fragment, we let the controller sort out what to do. If we don't have a fragment, we invoke `controller.wake()` to start a new game.

Summary
---

In this first post, we've seen how Misadventure behaves like a web site, with stable URLs that can be bookmarked or shared and with standard navigation like back and forwards. We've also seen that everything is done in the DOM, with no laborious refreshing of the entire page.

In [Part II][pii] of this series, we'll look at `controller.wake()` in detail, exploring how controller methods are declared using Faux's little DSL, how parameters are inferred, how templates are displayed, and we'll look at `route_to` helpers you can use in templates. In [Part III][piii], we'll look at a controller method that wires a model, a collection, and a view up to a template. Finally, in [Part IV][piv], we'll do a double-take and talk about loading classes.
