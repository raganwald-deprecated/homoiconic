Hungarian PBKAC
---

Hungarian notation (whether apps or systems) is useful, especially when you want some of the benefits of an untyped language but want to make [wrong code look wrong][1]. The trouble with it is just like the trouble with any documentation that isn't checked or enforced automatically: Over time the words diverge from the code, making it worse than useless because it actively deceives.

Here is some actual code I found in a current project today.

    def self.to_a_by_based_on
      all.inject({}) do |hash, edit|
        hash.tap { |h| (h[edit.based_on] ||= []) << edit }
      end
    end

    def self.to_a_by_scope
      all.inject({}) do |hash, edit|
        hash.tap { |h| (h[edit.scope] ||= []) << edit }
      end
    end

Sure, a generator could be used to DRY up the code. But before we get there... What do the method names promise and what do the methods deliver?  Need I say that a quick "blame" in git revealed that these lines were written by the usual suspect?
